# team-github-exercise
This is the team Github exercise for the speaking portal project group B.
Here we have 4 separate features that can be applied to an array of integers
These are separated on branches, and compiled into the development branch
These features consist of a method to find the average of an array, the variance of the array, the array reversed as well as the array sorted.
